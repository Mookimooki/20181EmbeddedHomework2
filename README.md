Proximaity alarm
----------------

I made alarm using ultrasonic sensor.

This alarm warns when something approaches to this sensor closer than 30cm.

This sensor is not accurate, in other words, it can't distinguish between what should be warned and what shoudn't be warned.

So, it has the gap variable.

If it once detects something closer than 30cm, It keeps warning until the object farther than 33cm(30cm + gap).

Depending on the situation, we can change the gap variable.

Finally, I think it could be applied to rear alarm for car and stuff.
